/*
Java HashMap
In the ArrayList chapter, you learned that Arrays store items as an ordered collection, and you have to access
them with an index number (int type). A HashMap however, store items in "key/value" pairs, and you can access them
 by an index of another type (e.g. a String).

One object is used as a key (index) to another object (value). It can store different types:
 String keys and Integer values, or the same type, like: String keys and String values:
